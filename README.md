# Hi! Welcome to Delivery App

This is a simple app to order food from different restaurants. It consists of
two pages (Shops and Cart). In the cart, you can increase or decrease the number
of dishes, and see the total cost of the order. Contact clients`s details along
with the order can be seen in the database (Mockapi)
